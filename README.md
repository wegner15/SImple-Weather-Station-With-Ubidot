# SImple-Weather-Station-With-Ubidot
This is a simple weather station build with Node MCU 
Sensors Used: 
1. DHT11
2. BMP180
3. Rain Sensor 
DHT11 was used to measure the temperature and humidity 
BMP180 was used to measure altitude, temperature (the dht11 values are more accurate)
Rain sensor was used to detarmine if it was raining
The dew point was then calculated to determine the possibility of rain
